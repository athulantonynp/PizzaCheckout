**Walkthrough Instructions**
- [ ]  If you are looking for the core business logic, Head out to `java/athul/pizza/checkout/data/CheckoutRepository.kt`
- [ ] UI component code is written in the package `java/athul/pizza/checkout/ui`
- [ ]  Test cases are found in `PizzaCheckout/app/src/test`


**A general flow of the app would be,**

UI <---> ViewModel (MainViewModel.kt) <--> Model / Repository (CheckoutRepository.kt &  JSON storage for data source (Hardcoded asset file for now) )

**UI:** It contains the UI Code. A composable function is a smallest unit of a UI, Also sends the user action to the ViewModel but does not receive the response back directly. All responses are recieved via flow APIs of viewmodel

**ViewModel**: It acts as a connection between the View and the business logic. Furthermore, it doesn't have any idea about which View it has to use as it does not possess a direct reference with the View. Hence, the ViewModel isn't aware of the view that it is interacting with.

**Model**: It represents the business logic and the data of an Application. It also consists of the business logic - local and remote data source, model classes, repository.
